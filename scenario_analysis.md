# Scenario Analysis: Current Design Coverage

## 🎯 Core Scenarios

### 1. **PLANNING (Fresh Data Queries)**
| Query Type | Current Handling | Efficiency | Issues |
|------------|------------------|------------|---------|
| Simple data retrieval | ✅ schema → query → execution | 🟢 Good | None |
| Complex analysis | ✅ schema → query → execution → python | 🟢 Good | May over-analyze |
| Visualization request | ✅ schema → query → execution → python → viz | 🟢 Good | None |
| Ambiguous query | ✅ schema → user_interaction → query | 🟡 OK | Limited clarification |

### 2. **FOLLOW-UP (Context-Dependent)**
| Query Type | Current Handling | Efficiency | Issues |
|------------|------------------|------------|---------|
| "Change chart type" | ✅ python → viz (skip schema) | 🟢 Excellent | Sample data fallback |
| "Explain that result" | ✅ python only | 🟢 Good | No actual data access |
| "Add filter to above" | ⚠️ May re-run full workflow | 🟡 Suboptimal | Context loss |
| "Show more details" | ⚠️ May re-run full workflow | 🟡 Suboptimal | Context loss |

### 3. **CASUAL (Non-Data Interactions)**
| Query Type | Current Handling | Efficiency | Issues |
|------------|------------------|------------|---------|
| "Hello" | ❌ Goes through data workflow | 🔴 Poor | Over-engineering |
| "How are you?" | ❌ Goes through data workflow | 🔴 Poor | Wrong pipeline |
| "What can you do?" | ❌ Goes through data workflow | 🔴 Poor | No help system |
| "Thank you" | ❌ Goes through data workflow | 🔴 Poor | Context unaware |

## 🔄 Permutation Matrix

### **PLANNING → FOLLOW-UP Chains**
```
Fresh Query → Follow-up → Result
-------------------------------
"NBA player stats" → "show as bar chart" → ✅ Works well
"Sales data" → "change to line chart" → ✅ Works well  
"Complex analysis" → "explain this" → ⚠️ May lose context
"Multi-table join" → "add filter" → ⚠️ May re-run expensive query
```

### **CASUAL → PLANNING Transitions**  
```
Casual → Planning → Result
--------------------------
"Hi" → "Show me sales data" → ❌ Inefficient double workflow
"Thanks" → "NBA stats" → ❌ Casual query wasted
"Help" → "Complex query" → ❌ No onboarding
```

### **FOLLOW-UP → CASUAL Transitions**
```
Follow-up → Casual → Result  
---------------------------
"Change chart" → "Thank you" → ❌ Casual goes through data pipeline
"Explain result" → "That's helpful" → ❌ Poor conversation flow
```

### **COMPLEX PERMUTATIONS**
```
Multi-step Conversations:
1. "Hello" (casual) 
2. "Show NBA stats" (planning)
3. "Change to pie chart" (follow-up)
4. "Add team filter" (follow-up)  
5. "Thanks!" (casual)

Current Issues:
- Step 1: Unnecessarily complex
- Steps 2-4: Good workflow
- Step 5: Wrong pipeline again
```

## 🚨 Critical Design Gaps

### **1. Intent Classification Weakness**
- **Problem**: All queries go through data workflow
- **Impact**: Inefficient for 30-40% of casual interactions
- **Solution Needed**: Pre-flight intent classification

### **2. Data Persistence Gap**
- **Problem**: Follow-ups use sample data instead of actual results
- **Impact**: Broken context for complex analyses  
- **Solution Needed**: Result caching & retrieval system

### **3. Conversation Flow Management**
- **Problem**: No understanding of conversation state
- **Impact**: Poor user experience for natural interactions
- **Solution Needed**: Session-aware conversation manager

### **4. Context Window Limitations**
- **Problem**: Only 2-3 recent queries for context
- **Impact**: Loses context in longer conversations
- **Solution Needed**: Smarter context summarization

## 🎯 Recommended Improvements

### **1. Three-Tier Intent Classification**
```python
# Pre-flight classification
intent = classify_intent(query)
if intent == "casual":
    return handle_casual_response(query)
elif intent == "follow_up":
    return handle_follow_up(query, context)
else:
    return handle_data_planning(query)
```

### **2. Result Persistence System**  
```python
# After each execution
save_query_results(session_id, query_id, {
    'sql': sql_query,
    'data': results,
    'metadata': column_info,
    'timestamp': now
})

# In follow-up detection
previous_data = get_recent_results(session_id, limit=3)
```

### **3. Smart Context Management**
```python
# Conversation-aware context building
context = build_smart_context(
    query=current_query,
    history=conversation_history,
    max_tokens=2000,
    include_data=is_follow_up
)
```

## 📊 Design Intelligence Score

| Aspect | Score | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| **Planning Intelligence** | 8/10 | Excellent workflow routing & complexity handling |
| **Follow-up Intelligence** | 7/10 | Good detection, but data persistence issues |
| **Casual Intelligence** | 3/10 | Poor - treats everything as data query |
| **Permutation Handling** | 6/10 | Good for data workflows, poor for mixed scenarios |
| **Context Management** | 6/10 | Basic conversation awareness |
| **Overall Smartness** | 6.5/10 | Strong for data-focused interactions, weak for natural conversation |

## 🚀 Next Steps for Maximum Intelligence

1. **Implement Intent Pre-Classification** (High Priority)
2. **Add Result Persistence Layer** (High Priority)  
3. **Create Casual Conversation Handler** (Medium Priority)
4. **Enhance Context Window Management** (Medium Priority)
5. **Add Conversation State Tracking** (Low Priority)
